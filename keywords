else - conditional, activates when the rest of the if, else if conditions are not met.

switch- The switch case in java executes one statement from multiple ones. Thus, it is like an if-else-if ladder statement.

for- create a loop

do: Java do keyword is used in the control statement to declare a loop. followed by while look

while: Java while loop is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given Boolean conditio
