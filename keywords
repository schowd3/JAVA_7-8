-for data types
byte, short, int , long, float, double , char, boolean

Primitive Data types(in bytes):
	byte: 1
	short: 2
	integer (int): 4
	long: 8 (23.23l)—needs to have a l in the end
	float:4 (232.23f) –needs to have a f in the end
	double: 8
	boolean: T or F (1bit)
	char: 2 
	
	Non-primitive:
	String

flow control	
if , else, switch, case, default, for , do , while, break, continue, return
if -  make a conditional
else - conditional, activates when the rest of the if, else if conditions are not met.

switch- The switch case in java executes one statement from multiple ones. Thus, it is like an if-else-if ladder statement. 

default- The default keyword the default block of code in a switch statement. The default keyword specifies some code to run if there is no case match in the switch.
for- create a loop

do: Java do keyword is used in the control statement to declare a loop. followed by while look

while: Java while loop is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given Boolean conditio

break: It is used to terminate loops and switch statements in java. When the break keyword is encountered within a loop, the loop is immediately terminated and the program control goes to the next statement following the loop.
continue :The continue keyword is used to end the current iteration in a for loop (or a while loop), and continues to the next iteration.

return- marks the end of a method that has a return type.

modifiers

static variable and method-Attributes and methods belongs to the class, rather than an object.
static block- init.Is used to initialize the static data member. It is executed before the main method at the time of classloading.
static class- A static nested class may be instantiated without instantiating its outer class. Inner classes can access both static and non-static members of the outer class. A static class can access only the static members of the outer class.
final var/methods- Attributes and methods cannot be overridden or modified
final class- The class cannot be inherited by other classes
abstract class- A class which is declared with the abstract keyword is known as an abstract class in Java. It can have abstract and non-abstract methods (method with the body).
abstract method- The method does not have a body. The body is defined by the subclass (inherited from).
synchronized- Methods can only be accessed by one thread at a time
native- The native keyword is used to declare a method which is implemented in platform-dependent code such as C or C++.
strictfp- Used for restricting floating-point calculations and ensuring same result on every platform while performing operations in the floating-point variable.
transient- Attributes and methods are skipped when serializing the object containing them.
volatile
